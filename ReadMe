ABSTRACT 
Importance: Recent work has found that tau accumulates differently in males and females, suggesting that Alzheimer Disease pathology may develop in a sex-specific manner.
Objective: The purpose of this analysis is to look for sex differences in both global and regional amyloid and tau deposition, as well as the downstream effects of this pathology on both neurodegeneration and cognitive performance.
Design, Setting, and Participants:  We analyzed amyloid and tau accumulation (PET Pittsburgh Compound B and AV-1451) in a cohort of cognitively normal individuals (n = 109) followed at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Aβ42 and tau) was obtained for a larger cohort (n = 558) of cognitively normal participants. Longitudinal structural MRI and neuropsychological testing were obtained for all.
Results: There is no global sex difference in tau relative to amyloid accumulation. Females have significantly higher tau for a given level of amyloid in the following regions:  frontal pole, lateral occipital, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, and rostral middle frontal regions. Tau accumulation in all of these regions but the lateral occipital is associated with a decline in cognitive performance for females only. 
Conclusions and Relevance:  While global differences in tau accumulation do not exist, there are regionally specific areas where women accumulate more tau for a given level of amyloid. This discrepancy in tau accumulation is clinically relevant, as increased tau in females’ frontal lobes is associated with declining cognition. Future studies should pursue sex-stratified designs whenever possible, as sex-specific pathology differences exist and have functional implications.
